# RaspberryPi-Translator
Term project for cs370. Creates a voice translator. 

## File 1: Speech to text (Plan)
- This file's main purpose will be to activate the microphone connected to either 1 computer, or to an externally connected microphone on the Raspberry Pi. The microphone will record the speaker's voice and save it as accurately as possible as a text string. 

## File 2: Text translator (Plan)
- This file's main purpose will be to take in the text string passed in from file 1 and using an online API, will send a json request with the expected response being the same string translated to another language. 
## File 3: Text to speech (Plan)
- This file's main purpose will be to use the JSON API response with the translated text, and output simulated voice allowing one to communicate in multiple languages using the raspberry pi.
